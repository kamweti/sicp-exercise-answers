Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers
in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec,
which decrements its argument by 1.

    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (+ (dec a) (inc b))))


Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in
evaluating `(+ 4 5)`.
Are these processes iterative or recursive?

    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

    (+ 4 5)
    (inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
    (inc (+ 3 5))
    (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
    (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
    (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc 6)))
    (inc (inc 7))
    (inc 8)
    9

The easiest way to spot that this process is recursive (without writing out the substitution) is to note that
the `+` procedure calls itself at the end while nested in another procedure


    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

    (+ 4 5)
    (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
    (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
    (+ 3 6)
    (+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
    (+ 2 7)
    (+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
    (+ 1 8)
    (+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
    (+ 0 9)
    9

this process on the other hand is a iterative process since the `+` procedure calls itself as the top expression
